# FIT3162-BDS
A repository for our FIT3162 Project - Better Display Server. 

We have used [Hipe](http://hipe.tech/) to create a to-do list app. This is a simple application that makes use of Hipe for the GUI, making it easy to develop GUIs for a desktop environment. 

[Hipe](http://hipe.tech/), created by Daniel Kos, is a display server and API that uses the DOM (Document Object Model), consisting of HTML and CSS rules, as its fundamental display language. These are easily understood by most programmers and web developers as it's the ubiquitous standard for the web. 

---

We have used Ubuntu Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS), and this is the version that we recommend you download if you'd like to follow along. It can be downloaded [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).


All documentation is contained within the *docs* folder. We have subdivided the documentation into two categories:
- Documentation on **how to make the to-do list app** (we have called it *To-doist*)
- Documentation on **using Hipe**

We have tried, as much as possible, to make a detailed and complete guide to using Hipe to create your own desktop applications and interfaces. The guide provided is intended to make it easier for developers to understand how Hipe works, common functions that will be used, how the HTML/CSS to Hipe code mapping works, as well as general guidance to make using Hipe a more pleasant experience. 

# TL;DR
We hope you learn something from our project. We recommend starting [here](docs/start_here.md).
